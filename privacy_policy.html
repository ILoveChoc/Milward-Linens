This encryption scrambles details such as credit card number, billing details and deliver address so that generally, other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security. To make sure you are accessing a secure server, check for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located generally either at the bottom left or top right of your browser window. If it appears, then SSL is active. You can double check this by looking at the URL as well. If SSL is active, then the first characters of that line will read ’https’ rather than just ‘http’. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Ensure you logout when you’ve finished visiting <span><a href="./index.html">www.milwardlinens.com.au</a></span>, especially if you access <span><a href="./index.html">www.milwardlinens.com.au</a></span> from a shared computer. </p>
